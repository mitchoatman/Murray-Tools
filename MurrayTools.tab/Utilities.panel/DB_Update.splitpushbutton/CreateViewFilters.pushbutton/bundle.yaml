tooltip: |-
  Creates filters for visible Fabrication services in active view.
  It will assign standard colors to know services.
  Any unknow services will be assigned randomized colors.
  
  If your view has a view template assigned to it, the filters
  will be added inside the template.
  Since some filters will have randomized colors it may be
  necessary to copy new filters to other view templates.

  Use the separate "Copy VG Filters" button for that.
